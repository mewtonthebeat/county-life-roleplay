# county-life-roleplay
County Life Roleplay is a gamemode written by me within the period of 3 years (2016 - 2019), as of now, I don't have time and motivation to continue developing this gamemode, but I don't want it to stay forgotten, so I decided to release it.

This gamemode had a lot of exterior and interior maps, but, because I didn't create them, I decide to not include them in this release - this also applies to custom models, there were about 100 mb of them, but I didn't make them, so, no models.

There is a lot of includes and plugins from SA-MP forum which were not made by me, however, I decided to include them in this package so it will be easier for you to start this gamemode.

**You need to download latest YSI package and include it, otherwise, gamemode won't compile.**
## Disclaimer

Gamemode has been heavily edited and untested before this release, that might result in unwanted bugs, like strange looking login screen, ELM light might not be working because they contained custom textdraw textures that weren't made by me.

It is suggested that you scroll down the source code and make changes suitable for you. This gamemode should be working, but it needs some work before you can start your own community on it.

To be honest, it might not work at all, I don't know.

**You will need to use SAMP 0.3.DL.**
**Aaand you will need to translate this gamemode from Slovak language to your own**
